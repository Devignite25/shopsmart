# Affiliate Landing Starter (Vitamins & Wellness)

A minimal, mobile-first static site to promote affiliate products in **Organic/Natural Health**, **Sports & Performance**, and **Family Wellness**.

## Quick start

1. **Edit content:**
   - `products.json` — update product list with your affiliate URLs.
   - `index.html` — update site title, description, and contact email.
   - `assets/logo.svg` — replace with your brand logo (keep the same filename).
   - `assets/og-card.png` — replace with a 1200×630 image for social previews.

2. **Preview locally:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # open http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Create a repo (e.g., `affiliate-landing-starter`).
   - Push these files to the **default branch**.
   - In **Settings → Pages**, set _Source_ to **Deploy from a branch**, and **/root**.
   - Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Swap placeholder links

Replace URLs like `https://example.com/affiliate/...` with your real affiliate links after approval by each program:

- iHerb — 10% intro, ~5% thereafter, 30-day cookie
- Onnit — 15% + $10 trial bonus, 45-day cookie
- Transparent Labs — 10%, 60-day cookie
- Nature’s Brands — 365-day cookie
